#Project Roadmap
3/10 - next:

-Get entry data format stubbed in at least, simple mobile UI
  -including cognitive distortions borrowed from dblog repo
-Try persisting entry data as part of localstorage


###Long-Term Goals

* Local storage for single-browser persistence, only

* Consider other secure, local options for persistence

* Option to download as a PDF or text file?

* Look into hosting on AWS or Google Cloud?

* Consider expanding to store user data in a cloud, behind authentication- HUGE task

###Medium Tasks

* Basic Accessibility pass (start this early!)

* Make past entries collapse and toggle-able (to expand)

* Rethink UI - try wire-framing main page?

* Set up SEO tags

* robots.txt?

* Branding / favicon?

* Set up a testing suite - basic testing

###Short-Term Goals

* Make mobile layout with stacked columns

* Find a good domain - cbt - feeling good, automatic thought jot, and nab it for future hosting

* Add some cool transitions / animations / snazz

* Add a linter to gulp task

* Update gulp task to auto-reload page after watch task
