# What is this?

"Your thoughts create your emotions; therefore, your emotions cannot prove that your thoughts are accurate." -David Burns

The automatic thought journal is a self-help method designed to assist you in talking back to your own internal critic.  It is a short exercise that helps you to overcome the bad habit of negative self-talk.  Sometimes this self-talk can be so habitual and ingrained that these thoughts seem almost automatic; by consciously responding them, you can a) teach yourself to recognize these critical thoughts, b) learn why these thoughts may be distorted and c) develop a more realistic self-evaluation system.  One such way of responding is by stepping through the thought and systematically breaking it down into discrete sections. Doing so can make it easier to identify distortions that may be occurring and, as a result, consider a new reaction to a potentially upsetting situation.

# How it works
* TODO: Ask for permission to use these examples?! *

In the original triple-column version*, there are only three steps:  First, identify the self-critical thought.  For instance, suppose you are late for an important meeting.  Your heart sinks, you're gripped with panic.  Ask yourself, "What thoughts are going through my mind right now?"  You might have been thinking "I never do anything right.  I'm always late." Write these down in the first column. You may have also thought "Everyone will look down on me.  This shows what a jerk I am." These are the MOST important thoughts to write down, as they are the source of the emotional upset.  Second, identify the cognitive distortion. What's a cognitive distortion? See below. Lastly, the most critical step in the exercise, is to substitute a more rational, less upsetting response in the final column. You cannot try to cheer yourself up by rationalizing or saying things you don't believe.  Instead, try to recognize the truth.  For example, in response to "I never do anything right" you could write: "Forget that! I do some things right and some wrong, just like everybody else.  I messed up on my meeting but let's not blow this up out of proportion."  

## But what if I can't think of a rational response to a negative thought?
Forget about it for a few days and come back to it later.  The more you practice breaking down thoughts, the easier it will get.  Don't be afraid to ask other people how they would respond to an upsetting thought if you can't figure out the rational response on your own. 

# So why not just use the original three-column version?
In the three column version it's easy to intermingle emotional responses with both the situation and the cognitive distortion. By breaking down the first step into three sections, you can clearly separate the three to better identify a) the situation itself, e.g. "I forgot Samantha's birthday", b) the thoughts that are simply emotional reactions, such as "I feel terrible", and c) the thoughts that are distorted conclusions "I'm a bad  person."

# What are cognitive distortions?

At the heart of this exercise is the ability to identify distorted conclusions that you may have been drawing about yourself or your life.**

* This method was originally created by David Burns and termed the "triple-column technique" in his book "Feeling Good" (year), and later developed into a more elaborate version called the "Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts" by Aaron Beck and his colleagues (Beck, Rush, Shaw & Emery, 1979).  This is the version that inspired this web application.  Because it's ${current year} and who has time for an elaborate work sheet on paper?***  For the best possible explanation of this exercise I highly recommend reading the original source - Feeling Good by David Burns.  

** This list, like the exercise itself, is authored by David Burns in his book Feeling Good.

Automatic Thought Journal was developed as a digital tool to make it easier for others to step through a multi-step short-form writing exercise.  We try our best to correctly attribute all sources of original work and will gratefully welcome any corrections.
