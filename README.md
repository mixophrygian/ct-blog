### What is this? 
A cognitive therapy journal format invented by David Burns in his book "Feeling Good". Known also as the "three column" technique, where the columns are
traditionally:

* "Automatic thoughts"

* "Distortions or errors"

* "Dispute the distortions"


But Burns' full journal has in fact five columns:

* "The Situation" - The thought or event, without any evaluation or emotion

* "Emotional response" - How you felt

* "The Automatic thought" - What you told yourself as a result of the situation and feeling

* "The Cognitive Distortions" - Identify how these thoughts are distorted, if you can

* "Rational Response" - A rational response to someone having those thoughts and feelings.
